    I had asked the five-year-old children to suggest ‘frog jumps’ on the class
    number line. To model subtraction the frog, ‘Freddie’, is placed on the
    line and then jumps back the number subtracted. Giannis has suggested that
    Freddie starts on the number 1.

    This vignette is taken from a series of lessons I carried out with a group
    of young children in Malta as part of a teaching/research experience. The
    frog jumps—which were key to the children’s learning about subtraction—are
    the focus of this article.
</p>
<p>
    As a teacher-educator, I teach elementary mathematics education to
    pre-service teachers, and frequently have contact with in-service teachers.
    One of my main areas of interest is language, and in my discussions with
    practitioners, I encourage them to give explicit attention to mathematical
    language. I wished to try out this recommendation for myself through a
    teaching/research experience in order to ‘practise what I preached’ and to
    be in a better position to reflect on this aspect of mathematics education.
    One of the classes I taught for this purpose included Giannis and the other
    children featured in the vignette above.
</p>
<p>
    Elsewhere (Farrugia, 2017) I focus on the children’s appropriation of
    aspects of the mathematics register in relation to subtraction as
    separation or ‘take away’. Here I consider subtraction on the number line,
    or ordinal subtraction, and focus on the integration of the various
    resources used, which I consider from a semiotic perspective. I offer an
    example of the application of semiotic theory to a practical teaching
    situation. Following this, I hone in more specifically on the function of a
    gesture mimicking a jumping frog. Using ‘everyday’ items is a common
    approach to addressing mathematical ideas with young children, and
    therefore I believe it is useful to study the role of gesture as they are
    used in conjunction with such items.
</p>
<p>
 <h1>   The research context </h1>
</p>
<p>
    Maltese is the home language of most of the population, but English plays
    an important role in many spheres of life and is the academic language of
    various subjects, including mathematics. Generally, during mathematics
    lessons it is common for teachers and students to mix Maltese and English
    for verbal communication whereas all written work is in English.
</p>
<p>
    However, from my professional experience, I can say that when faced with a
    class of mixed nationalities, teachers will tend to increase their use of
    English. Although English may not be a child’s home language, it is more
    likely that they would know—or to be supported by family members to
    learn—some English rather than Maltese. The class that participated in this
    study included a high number of such children. It comprised 22
    five-year-olds representing 13 nationalities. For example, the children
    named in the vignette above include Giannis (Greek), David (Maltese), Sven
    (Finnish/Kenyan), and Dragan (Serbian/Maltese).
</p>
<p>
    The class teacher, Ms Jenny, reported that all the children understood
    English, although their oral fluency varied from “doesn’t speak English” to
    “very fluent”. On the other hand, she described six children as having no
    or limited understanding of Maltese. The mix of nationalities in the class
    prompted Ms Jenny to use English as a <em>lingua franca</em> for
    mathematics, using Maltese occasionally with Maltese students. During my
    own lessons, I too used English as the main language of instruction, with
    occasional Maltese.
</p>
<p>
    After some informal observations, I substituted for Ms Jenny for eight
    mathematics lessons. The lessons were video-recorded and the children
    showed up on the camera if they, and their parents, consented.
    ‘Subtraction’ was a new school topic for the children. They were already
    familiar with the number line and the symbols + and = from previous lessons
    on addition carried out with Ms Jenny. I introduced the minus sign during
    our activities on subtraction as separation or ‘take away’. Hence, the
    children were already familiar with the symbol when we worked on ordinal
    subtraction, the focus of the present article.
</p>
<p>
    My main interest while planning the lessons was English mathematics
    terminology in order to support the children in expressing concepts and
    ideas (Lee, 2006). Thus, my planning included ‘lining up’ mathematics and
    language objectives as recommended by Gibbons (2015). My teaching approach
    included stressing verbal expressions and offering sentence frames with
    which the children could work in pairs or contribute to a class discussion.
    This approach to teaching mathematical language is encouraged by
    researchers such as Bresser, Melanese and Sphar (2009), who consider it
    particularly helpful with second language learners.
</p>
<p>
    <h1> A semiotic interpretation of the teaching/learning process </h1>
</p>
<p>
    As I planned the approach and activities that I was going to use in class,
    I was influenced by social semiotics. Social semiotics is a theoretical
    perspective that is concerned with how people construct systems of meanings
    through social interaction (Chapman, 2003), and hence it provides a
    relevant perspective for interpreting mathematics teaching and learning. By
    explaining the teaching/learning process using a semiotic perspective, I
    offer an illustration of an application of the theory. In particular, I
    draw on the work carried out by Maria G. Bartolini Bussi, Ferdinando
    Arzarello and their colleagues.
</p>
<p>
    Bartolini Bussi and her colleagues have developed a semiotic approach to
teaching and learning based on a Vygotskian perspective, and centres on the    <em>artefact. </em>Following Rabardel (1995), Bartolini Bussi and Mariotti
    (2008) distinguish between a material object <em>per se</em>, originally
    designed with some purpose in mind, and the <em>use</em> to which the
    object is put in the classroom. In the latter case the object acts as an
    instrument which is a “mixed entity […] born of both the subject and the
    object” (Rabardel &amp; Samurçay, 2001, p.20). According to Bartolini Bussi
    and Mariotti (2008) an artefact can be referred to as a tool of semiotic
    mediation as long as it is (or is conceived to be) <em>intentionally</em>
    used by the teacher to mediate some mathematical content. Thus, the teacher
    takes the role of cultural mediator (Mariotti, 2009). This role does not
    refer simply to the use of a tool or artefact to accomplish a task “but
    rather to the fact that new meanings, related to the actual use of the
tool, may be generated, and evolve, under the guidance of the expert (    <em>i.e., </em>the teacher)” (Bartolini Bussi &amp; Mariotti, 2008, p.
    754). Hence, an artefact has ‘semiotic potential’ that may be constructed
    and exploited (Bartolini Bussi, Corni, Mariani &amp; Falcade, 2012, p. 6).
    This potential is the double semiotic link between the artefact and, on one
    hand the immediate (situated) task to be accomplished and, on the other
    hand, mathematical meanings evoked by its use. Arzarello, Paola, Robutti
    and Sabena (2009) take a similar view, pointing out that signs may be
    personal (<em>e.g., </em>an idiosyncratic gesture carried out by a student)
    or institutional (<em>e.g., </em>algebraic notation). A teacher’s aim is
    therefore to support student appropriation of culturally shared, or
    ‘institutional’ meaning of signs.
</p>
<p>
    For my lessons on ordinal subtraction, the key resource, or artefact, used
    was a picture of a green frog named Freddie. This item was to act as an
    instrument, since I intentionally planned to use it to address some
    mathematical content. There were two versions of the frog. The large one
    was attached to a broomstick and was generally used by myself. It was made
    to ‘jump’ along the classroom number line, consisting of large separate
    number cards attached with clothes pegs to a string that ran across the
    room. The children had similar small frogs which were used in conjunction
    with small laminated (continuous) number lines on their tables. These items
    are shown in Figures 1 and 2.

</p>
<p>
    Occasionally, and especially when I first handed out the small frogs, the
    children carried out their own personal actions with this item. For
    example, David held the frog up high above his head, then dropped it to the
    table, or onto Dragan’s head; Dragan slid the frog along his desk, telling
    me that he had named his frog ‘Foxy’. Mohammed and Shania attached their
    frogs to their index fingers with adhesive putty and wagged the fingers at
    each other, as though their frogs were chatting. Bartolini Bussi and
Mariotti (2008) refer to these personal actions as <em>artefact</em>    <em> signs </em>since they arise from the individual or paired activity
    related directly with the object. These signs can include writing, drawing,
    language and gestures and their meanings are personal.
</p>
<p>
    While I did not stop the children from ‘playing’, or rather, carrying out
    their own personalised actions with the artefact, it was necessary to get
    them focused on the jumping action in order to approach the mathematics I
had in mind. My ultimate aim was for the children to access    <em>mathematical signs</em> which, as explained by Bartolini Bussi and
    Mariotti, relate to the mathematical meanings as shared by the wider
    community. Thus, I channeled the children to use the artefact in a
    particular way, in order to enable them to set up a link between the item,
    language, symbols, and graphics. Arzarello (2006) considers the combined
    use of various resources as a ‘semiotic bundle’. He defines a semiotic
    bundle as a collection of sets of signs that are used in relation to an
    artefact (speech, writing, gestures, gazes, drawing and others) together
    with a set of relationships between the sets. In my case, the semiotic sets
    used in conjunction with the artefact were:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Spoken language, including the expressions ‘count back’, ‘jump
    back’/‘minus’, ‘equals’; written language: ‘count back’
</li>

    <li>
        Symbols: numerals 0–10, –, =
    </li>

    <li>
    Graphics: representations of the number line on worksheets
</li>

<li>
     Gestures: the key gesture of causing a frog to jump on the number line
    (large / small frogs), and using finger movements to indicate a backward
    direction on the line. (Pointing and other gestures are not given
    prominence in this paper; similarly, gazes are mentioned briefly, but not
    examined in detail.)
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The semiotic bundle initially included the physical artefact (frog), spoken
    language, the numerals (symbols), gestures and gazes. An example is shown
    in Table 1, an annotated transcript involving Andrea, who is suggesting an
    example, and the rest of the children, who are listening attentively. In
    the transcript, the components of the bundle are separated in what
    Arzarello (2006) calls a synchronic analysis of the bundle, wherein the
    simultaneous components of the unitary system are distinguished.

    Table 1. Initial components of the semiotic bundle
</p>

<p>
    The interaction was a ‘collective production’ of the semiotic sets
    (Bartolini Bussi and Mariotti, 2008). In my teaching design, collective
    production tended to precede the individual production of signs since
    starting with a class discussion allowed me to introduce the necessary
    language, including sentence frames, that I wished to encourage.
</p>
<p>
    Arzarello (2006) argues that learning occurs through a dynamically
    developing bundle, which enlarges through genetic conversions.
    ‘Enlargement’ of a bundle refers to an increase in the number of active
    sets within the bundle and an increase in the number of relationships (and
    transformations) between the different semiotic sets. Hence, a bundle can
    also be analysed diachronically, that is over time, as lessons progress
    (Arzarello, 2006). Over the course of my lessons the semiotic bundle was
    enlarged through the inclusion of graphics and written language. These were
    brought into play through the children’s engagement with their small number
    lines and worksheets. The semiotic bundle was further enlarged with the
    introduction of symbols. For example, as one child instructed the frog to
    move, another child would suggest the institutional signs that could be
used to represent the movement (<em>e.g.,</em> 6 – 4 = 2) and thus to    <em> </em>express ordinal subtraction.<em> </em>The gradual genetic
    conversions that I targeted in order to enable a move from the context of a
    jumping frog to institutionalised meaning of symbols symbolisation are
    shown in Figure 3. The first row refers to oral expression related to the
    artefact; the second row refers to written symbols, text and
    non-institutional symbols; the third row refers to institutional signs.

    I now focus more specifically on one element of the bundle, namely, the
    gesture of moving or mimicking the jumping frog.

  <h1>  A gesture as a pivot sign </h1>
</p>
<p>
    Bartolini Bussi and Mariotti (2008) define <em>pivot signs</em> as ones
    that enable the passage from artefact to mathematical context. These signs
    link the artefact with the mathematical context by way of their relation to
    both. Through the analysis of my data I noted how a gesture can serve as a
    pivot sign.
</p>
<p>
    The importance of gestures in the development of mathematical ideas has
    been given attention in recent research. Indeed, drawing on the work of
David McNeill (for McNeill see, for example, 1992, 2005), Arzarello    <em>et al.</em> (2009) and Arzarello, Robutti and Thomas (2015) give
    particular attention to the gesture as a component of the semiotic bundle
    in the context of high school students working on graphs. In a similar
    vein, and in relation to high-school students working on the parabola,
    continued fractions and induction. Krause (2016) gives details of how
    gestures served to prepare, support and realise epistemic actions, thus
    serving an “epistemic function” (p. 246). She notes the use of particular
    gestures that became situationally conventionalised through recurrent use,
    and thus became <em>associated</em> with a mathematical idea or object as
    it developed.
</p>
<p>
    In my study the key gesture was one that moved the frog, or mimicked this
    movement. The initial gesture used was that of moving the frog along the
    class number line and along the children’s individual number lines. Thus,
    as noted by Krause (2016), a situationally conventionalised gesture became
    associated with a mathematical idea. However, by the third lesson, few
    children bothered to use the small frog when using their number lines or
    when completing their worksheet. Some children told me that they did not
    need the frog as I handed the little pictures out, while other children
    simply left the frog unused on their table. Instead, these children carried
    out subtractions on the number line by moving their index finger backwards
    along the line in arch-like movements. Thus, the gesture of moving the frog
    was modified to a related finger movement. This gesture appeared to serve
    as a pivot sign (Bartolini Bussi &amp; Mariotti, 2008) which enabled the
    passage from artefact to mathematical context, namely subtraction with
    numbers up to 10. After a while, some children appeared to work out answers
    to subtractions by only looking at the number line printed on their
    worksheet, giving me the impression that they were ‘performing’ the gesture
    mentally.
</p>
<p>
    The ordinal interpretation of subtraction is based on the grounding
    metaphor <em>arithmetic is motion</em> as described by Lakoff and Núñez
    (1997, pp. 34-35). The metaphor is ‘grounding’ since it grounds
    mathematical ideas in everyday experience, in this case moving through
    space. In accordance with this metaphor, numbers are locations on a path,
    zero is the origin, operations are acts of moving on that path, and
    subtraction is taking steps a given distances to the left (or backwards).
    Since the gestures of moving the frog and moving a finger are linked to the
    grounding metaphor, I refer to them as <em>grounding gestures</em>. I
    suggest that it is at the stage of mental manipulation that projection of
    the motion-metaphor to the domain of mathematics is achieved. The stages
    are summarised in Table 2.

<p>
 <h1>   The extension of the number line </h1>
</p>
<p>
    The five-year-old children were, of course, too young to appreciate an
    extension of the number line to negative numbers; according to Ms Jenny, a
    few of them were still consolidating their knowledge of the counting
    numbers, and they had only recently been introduced to the number line
    during the topic addition. For the purpose of my lessons, the 0 was assumed
    to be the end of the line. However, in the course of the class discussions,
    the idea of left-of-zero cropped up and I believe this awareness can be
    considered to be an early first step to an appreciation of the potential
    extension of the number line. Indeed, Lakoff and Núñez (1997) consider the
    motion metaphor to offer to “easiest natural extension […] to negative
    numbers” (p. 39). The vignette I presented at the beginning of this article
    formed part of the discussion of the ‘end of the line’. I now return to the
    vignette, giving details of what came before and after, thus rendering its
    significance to the learning about subtraction more evident.
</p>
<p>
    In the lesson before, Shania suggested the frog starts on 1, then jumps
    back 2. The other children called out in chorus “zero!” while I said that
    Freddie had fallen off the line, carrying out a falling gesture to the
    floor using the large frog. I did not consider it necessary to pursue the
    point further; considering their age I accepted their chorus answer of
    “zero” and moved on. The next day I asked the children to recapitulate the
    previous day’s work. Giannis had put up his hand eagerly, with a smug smile
    on his face. At the time, and again on revisiting the video, it is evident
    that Giannis had something ‘up his sleeve’. The unnamed children are off
    camera and not identified.

</p>

    <em>Children</em>
    <em>[Put their hands up eagerly]</em>

</p>
<p>
    <em>MTF</em>
    I think that Giannis KNEW that it was one, but he was playing a trick on
    Freddie! I think he wanted him to fall off.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Child 2 </em>
    Even I!
</p>
<p>
    At the time, it appeared to me that Giannis had what Barnes (2000) calls a
    ‘magical moment in mathematics’, which she describes as a moment of sudden
    realisation of new understanding, accompanied by a positive emotion such as
    delight or satisfaction. Perhaps Giannis had held onto this thought from
    the previous day when I had commented that the frog had fallen off the
    line, or perhaps he came to ‘see’ it there and then. I am not in a position
    to say. The idea may have been prompted by what was the favourite example
of many of the children’s, namely, instances when the frog landed on zero (    <em>e.g., </em>5 – 5 = 0). Interestingly, Giannis’ insight appeared to be
    quickly taken up by other children. As evidence for this, I consider
    David’s concern that “he will fall down”, the children’s laughter and
    squealing, Child 2’s claim that he too wished to drop the frog off the
    line, and the children’s ability to suggest numbers such that the frog
    would <em>not</em> fall off the line. This illustrates Dooley’s (2007)
    point that whole-class settings can be the site for the construction of
    collective ‘aha’ moments. As Dooley points out, it is difficult to analyse
    to what extent all members of the large group have understood, and I can
    only draw conclusions for some of the children based on their classroom
    input and interview data as illustrated in the following excerpt taken from
    Mohammed’s interview. Here we were discussing subtraction with respect to
    the small laminated number line.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Mohammed</em>
    [<em>Places the frog on 10]</em> I’m going to do something funny! Jump ten,
    no eleven.<em> [Count</em><em>s while moving the frog back] </em>[…] nine,
    ten, eleven. BOOM! <em>[Moves frog off the line]</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>MTF</em>
    What happens when you move eleven?
</p>
<p>
    <em>Mohammed</em>
    It’s fall.
</p>
<p>
    <em>MTF</em>
    Can you give me an example when he does NOT fall off the line?
</p>
<p>
    <em>Mohammed</em>
    Aha [yes]. Move three.
</p>
<p>
    This excerpt shows that Mohammed was able to distinguish between numbers
    that would take the frog off the line and ones that would not, and that
    that the classroom experiences had helped him become aware of the
‘distance’ and the ‘zero is the origin’ elements suggested by the    <em>arithmetic as motion</em> metaphor.
</p>
<p>
   <h1> Conclusion </h1>
</p>
<p>
    My original aim in undertaking this teaching/research experience was to
    explore the explicit teaching of mathematical language. Thus during the
    planning phase my attention was more on the language elements of the
    semiotic sets to be used, rather than on gesture. However, on analysis of
    the videos I was prompted to reflect in more detail on the key gesture that
    represented movement on the number line. Due to the close integration of
    various elements of the semiotic bundle, it is not possible to tease out
    the influence of each element on children’s learning. However, the
    children’s active engagement with the jumping frog and related actions
    suggests that the gesture was an important factor in their learning of
    ordinal subtraction.
</p>
<p>
    The power of gestures is well recognised in general mathematics education,
    so possibly the jumping gesture would be useful in any classroom of young
    children, even a monolingual group. Bresser, Melanese and Sphar (2009)
    stress however that gestures are important to use with second language
    learners. Possibly, since English was the second language of many of the
    children in the class and the school topic subtraction was new to them, the
    gesture may have been particularly helpful. I suggest that the action of
    causing the frog to jump may have offered a (presumably universally
    understood) element with which to interpret the new English terminology
like <em>jump back, minus</em>, and so on, and the new symbolisation    <em>e.g., </em>7 – 2 = 5. The meaning potential of the artefact, the frog,
    was further extended through the suggestion of it falling off the line.
</p>
<p>
    The gesture was originally related directly to the artefact but was
    modified by the children into arch-like finger movements as they moved
    along their number lines. This movement appeared to act as a pivot sign,
    linking the frog context to the mathematical domain. Indeed, over the
    lessons, a number of children stopped using the frog and their fingers, but
    seemed to perform the gesture mentally.
</p>
<p>
I consider the gestures of moving the frog and finger to be    <em>grounding gestures</em> since they are related to the grounding
    metaphor <em>arithmetic is motion</em> (Lakoff &amp; Núñez, 1997). Similar
    gestures would be applicable for carrying out other operations in the
    number line. For example, by taking steps a given distance to the right
    (addition) or by repeatedly segmenting a path of given length into as many
    smaller paths of a given length (division, as described by Lakoff &amp;
    Núñez). Movement is also used when carrying out operations on a 100-grid,
    which is another commonly used resource in elementary school. It may be
    interesting to study movement gestures associated with this resource. Other
metaphors for arithmetic given by Lakoff and Núñez are <em>arithmetic is object collection</em> and    <em>arithmetic is object construction</em>. My teaching of subtraction as
    ‘take away’, carried out in the days prior to ordinal subtraction, would
    fall under the former metaphor. Here “subtraction is taking smaller
    collections from larger collections to form other collections” (p. 35). A
    next research step for me could be to re-visit the ‘take away’ lessons and
    analyse the gestures used in these lessons to describe their relation with
    the underlying metaphor.
</p>
<p>
    More generally, more research can be done to explore the role of gesture in
    semiotic bundles (Arzarello, 2006) utilised in elementary school
    classrooms. It is common practice for teachers of young children to use
    ‘everyday’ items as a starting point for mathematical ideas. It would be
    interesting to explore if, and how, gestures serve as pivot signs to help
    the children—whether first or second language learners—move from the
    immediate context to the mathematical domain.
