  <Blockquote>The equations below express the relationship between
a person's height, H, and femur length, F:
<br> <br>
Males: H = 27.5 + 2.24F
<br>Females: H = 24 + 2.32F
<br> 
<br>
[...] If a man's femur is 20 inches long, about how tall is he?
(Lappan, Fey, Fitzgerald, Friel and Phillips, 1998, p 21)
</Blockquote>

<p>
Students could respond in many ways to this prompt from a
mathematics textbook. They might just answer the questions
in the expected way, or they might pose further questions.
These questions could be mathematical or about mathematics,
such as the following: Who found these equations?
How? Why would someone want to use these equations? For
whom and why am I finding the man's height? Should my
answer depend on the situation?


<p>
Using tools and concepts from discourse analysis we
demonstrate a framework for examining the way a textbook
might influence a mathematics learner's experience of mathematics.
We are interested in the way the form of textbook
language and accompanying images might position students
in relation to mathematics, to their classmates, to their teachers
and to their world outside of the classroom. Though the
typical student's experience of a textbook is mediated by
strong influences, including the teacher who prescribes the
textbook and the school culture, the form of the textbook
itself is significant (Otte, 1986). As researchers interested in
discourse, ideology, and power, we assert the importance of
understanding the way students are positioned by mathematics
textbooks and offer one way to examine such positioning.
</p>
<p>
The milieu of a classroom comprises teachers, students,
and textbooks. Within this milieu, the student's position in
the classroom setting is complex: it is affected by both local
and global discourses and also by both the individual words
spoken and written by others and the system of these words
taken together. Thus the interpretation that underpins our
framework requires both 'zooming in' and 'zooming out.'
When examining a textbook, we recognize that textbooks can
be examined as wholes made up of parts. It is important to
interrogate the text word-by-word, sentence-by-sentence, and
section-by-section to identify and classify particular linguistic
forms. But, it is also important to consider these linguistic
forms as parts of a whole (each word is part of a sentence as well 
as part of a section within a unit) and interpret the function
of language forms in their textual contexts. Throughout
this article, we describe particular linguistic forms but use
their location to interpret what they might mean for a reader.
</p>
<p>
To illustrate this textbook analysis framework, we take
examples from our analyses of two particular textbooks. We
draw upon our more extensive analysis of a unit from the
<i>Connected Mathematics Project</i> (CMP), <i>Thinking with
Mathematical Models</i> (TMM) (Lappan et al., 1998) as well
as some analysis we have done of the <i>University of Chicago
School Mathematics Project</i>'s (UCSMP) book entitled <i>Algebra</i>
(McConnell et al., 1998). While we recognize that these
particular curriculum materials are used primarily in the US,
our textbook choices are irrelevant in the sense that our
framework could be illustrated with any textbook. However,
we believe that using examples clarifies the framework better
than abstract statements could. For a more detailed
analysis of TMM and of some of these linguistic tools see
Herbel-Eisenmann (in press). In our analyses of these texts,
we focused attention on words and phrases that constructed
roles for the reader in relationship with other people and
with mathematics from a particular epistemological stance.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Our framework</h2>
<p>
Our framework is not an end in itself. Our intention in this
article is to model critical evaluation of mathematics textbooks.
We have chosen the word framework because we
provide a structure for questioning what a mathematics educator
might bring to a textbook. This word also makes it
clear that our approach is one among other powerful critical
approaches, including Dowling's (1998) approach, which is
underpinned by Basil Bernstein's sociology, and McBride's
(1989; 1994) Foucauldian approach. Both of these approaches,
unlike ours, are oriented toward declaring a verdict on a textbook's
effect.
</p>
<p>
We introduce a perspective-opening framework to mathematics
textbook consideration. Typically, textbooks are
taken to index mathematical content. The verbal, diagrammatic
and pictorial symbols are taken as transparent pointers
to mathematical ideas. While acknowledging that this is
appropriate, we assert the value of drawing attention to the
symbols themselves. Such a turn of attention has underpinned
significant mathematics education scholarship -
including attention to the nature of mathematical symbols
(Radford, 2002), the pragmatics of grammar (Rowland, 
1992, 1999) and the genres of mathematical expression
(Gerofsky, 1996).
</p>
<p>
In Adler's (1998) accounts of tensions faced by mathematics
teachers (tensions exacerbated in multilingual
contexts), she describes the dilemma of deciding when to
direct attention to mathematical content and when to direct it
to the language used to represent the content. It is not necessary
to see the choice as mutually exclusive; we promote
attention to linguistic form as it relates to mathematical content.
Our framework is not about attending to linguistic
structure instead of mathematical content. [1] Attention to
the relationship helps us understand both the content and the
language practice.
</p>
<p>
Our framework is organized by a series of questions. With
these questions we explore how the things that they allow
us to see relate to the things we typically see (mathematical
content):
</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>How might a textbook position students in relation to mathematics?</li>
  <li>How might a textbook position students in relation to their peers?</li>
  <li>How might a textbook position students in relation to their teacher?</li>
  <li> How might a textbook position students in relation to other people?</li>
  <li>How might a textbook position students in relation to their own experiences?</li>
</ol>
<p>
Before illustrating a way to answer these questions, we
address two other significant questions: Who should be asking
the above questions? and Why might they do so?
Though we are not saying who should be attending to textbook
form in relation to mathematical content, we envision
teachers doing this primarily. Teachers can also draw students
into conversation about these things. Love and Pimm
(1996), in their discussion about ways of looking at mathematics
textbooks, point out the inherent authority of the text
and remind teachers and students that together.
</p>

<Blockquote>their responses to it may range from taking it for granted
to seeing their role as challenging and criticizing it (to
interrogate and even deconstruct the text).
(p. 380)
</Blockquote>
<p>
This possibility available to teachers and students needs further
research. Wagner (2007), in his attempt to raise the
"critical language awareness" of a high-school mathematics
class over a semester-long course, drew some attention to
textbook language form but most of the class discussion
about language focused on oral communication. We argue
that the NCTM's (2000) move to make communication an
"outcome" increases the importance of students noticing
language.
</p>
<p>
An important word common to these questions is the
word 'might'. With our questions, we are more interested in
the 'range of possibility' than in classification for a few reasons.
First, though we recognize that it would be convenient
to have a framework that allows us to classify and thus recommend
particular textbooks for use, we do not find 
linguistic analysis sufficient to make such classifications.
We have some interest in noting what a text is but the complexity
of text in relation to readers of diverse experience
makes it difficult to nail down what a text is. We also have
some concern for how texts might be improved, addressing
questions about how they ought to be. However, our primary
interest is to draw attention to possibilities that texts make
available for educators. Second, we are more interested in
supporting educators' use of textbooks than in influencing
their choice of textbooks. There is a wide range of mathematical
activities that can be prompted by a teacher using
any particular textbook section. Johansson (2007) demonstrates
some possibilities within this range in her description
of a teacher interacting with students doing work from a
textbook: the teacher can follow the textbook's assumptions
and structuring, or question the assumptions and structuring
to generate mathematical discussion. What might they
do, and how might an educator's work be informed by an
awareness of what texts can do? Supporting the textbook
users' repertoire of uses may help them make informed
choices between textbooks, even if this kind of support does
not make easy choices possible. Third, there is value in considering
a range of possible forms of a text, to support
authors' choices when writing mathematics textbooks and
teachers' choices when writing notes for their students.
</p>
<p>
The interrogation of textbooks using frameworks such as
the one we present here can be complemented by the study
of how textbooks are used in classrooms. In a recent review
on mathematics teachers' use of curriculum materials,
Remillard (2006) argued that there is a need for detailed
work related to how teachers use curriculum materials.
Some of the work Remillard writes about has focused on
the relationship between the teacher and the textbook, viewing
both as bringing agency to the teacher-curriculum
relationship. That is, while the teacher brings, say, beliefs
and knowledge to the use of curriculum and hence adapts it
as he or she uses it, the textbook also brings particular
knowledge and viewpoints about what school mathematics
entails. We agree with Brown and Edelson (2003) and Lloyd
(1999) who argue that in order to investigate teachers' use of
curriculum materials it is necessary to interrogate the materials
themselves.
</p>

<h2>Critical orientation</h2>

<p>
The investigation of possibility usually accompanies a critical
agenda. Though the post-structuralist turn in scholarship
would seem to favour research that investigates language,
critical theorists deem most linguistic scholarship as structuralist
(MacLure, 2003). There are, however, streams of
linguistics in which some critical theorists identify sufficient
recognition of subjectivity and of the impossibility of language
being a neutral medium - including critical discourse
analysis (CDA). CDA scholarship aims to support modification
of language practices by drawing attention to alternative
possibilities. In order to do this, scholarship needs to 'denaturalize'
discursive practices - to compel change by asking
questions that make apparently normal practice seem strange
(Kress, 1990) and to empower participants in a discourse
by uncovering for them (and perhaps with them, we add) a
range of possible ways of living and participating within 
the discourse. Fairclough (1995), like Kress, points to the CDA
analyst's interest in the relative positioning of participants:
</p>
<p>
<Blockquote>Adopting critical goals means aiming to elucidate [...]
naturalizations, and more generally to make clear social
determinations and effects of discourse which are characteristically
opaque to participants.
(p. 28) [2]
</Blockquote>
<p>
We read intention where it would appear that the textbook
authors are instinctively following the traditions of the mathematics
textbook genre. Kress (1993) makes it clear that
whenever a writer writes, or a speaker speaks, they are
making choices (not necessarily consciously) amongst alternative
structure and content. MacLure (2003) supports
Kress's assertion when she notes that poststructuralist reading
cannot see language as innocent. Writers should be
responsible for their conscious and unconscious choices.
</p>

<p>
Our framework's focus questions centre on this aspect of
the discourse, the social positioning experienced by students.
As we use the word 'positioning' we envision the
textbooks as having agency, moving people around to form
particular structures of relationship. This image is more than
metaphoric, as the prescribed forms of interaction actually
structure social settings, even the physical arrangement of
classroom participants. In recent poststructuralist theorizing
and investigations in mathematics education that have
begun to address personal positioning within learning discourses,
the interest has been in the person's relation or
attitude to disciplines or communities of practice, not to
other particular people. Our sense of a person's subjectivity
leads us to be more interested in how a student relates to
other people.
</p>
<p>
Language indirectly indexes particular dispositions,
understandings, values, and beliefs. By examining the language
choices authors make, we can see how they construct
a model reader and position mathematics students. From
this, we can infer the student's experience of mathematics.
</p>


<h2>Exemplifying the framework's questions</h2>

<p>
Authors' choices both reflect their sense of an ideal pedagogical
situation and direct the development of a situation
that resembles this ideal. [3] Thus, we argue that authors'
linguistic choices are artefacts of both the discursive practice
and the discursive system behind the practice. [4] These
artefacts give us insight into mathematics education in general
and they influence the development of mathematical
thinking in situations that involve the text.
</p>

<h2>How might a text position students in relation to mathematics?</h2>
<p>
To develop an understanding of how people are positioned
with respect to mathematics, we focus on two language
forms - personal pronouns and modality - and accompanying
images that substantiate these forms. With these forms,
we see who the text recognises as the people associated with
mathematics and how they stand in relation to the mathematics.
First person pronouns (I and we) indicate an author's
personal involvement with the mathematics. Textbook
authors can use the pronoun 'I' to model an actual person
doing mathematics, and can draw readers into the picture 
by using the pronoun 'we', though there is some vagueness
with regard to whom 'we' refers (Pimm, 1987). The use of
the second person pronoun 'you' also connects the reader to
the mathematics because it speaks to the reader directly,
though it can be used in a general sense, not referring to any
person in particular (Rowland, 2000).
</p>

<p>
Morgan (1996) notes that the absence of first person pronouns
obscures the presence of human beings in a text and
affects
</p>

<Blockquote>not only [...] the picture of the nature of mathematical
activity but also distances the author from the reader,
setting up a formal relationship between them.
(p. 6)</Blockquote>

<p>
In both example textbooks, first person pronouns were
entirely absent. Two forms of the second person pronoun
'you' are common in mathematics textbooks:
</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>'you' + a verb</li>
  <li>an inanimate object + an animate verb + 'you' (as direct object).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first form, includes such phrases as 'you find', 'you
know' and 'you think', with which the authors tell the readers
about themselves, defining and controlling what linguists
Edwards and Mercer (1987) call the "common knowledge".
The textbook authors use such control to point out the mathematics
they hope (or assume) the students are constructing.
Most uses of 'you' in the TMM and the UCSMP texts fit this
first structure.
</p>

<p>
The second of these constructions (an inanimate object +
an animate verb + 'you' (as direct object)) structures striking
examples of obscured human subjectivity. Inanimate objects
perform activities that are typically associated with people,
masking human agency - for example, 'The graph shows
you...' and 'The equation tells you...'. In reality it is not the
graph but the person who is reading the graph who determines
what the graph 'shows'. This type of obfuscation
depicts an absolutist image of mathematics, portraying
mathematical activity as something that can occur on its
own, without humans. This image can be mitigated by other
features that showcase human agency, for example, TMM
refers to human actors in the mathematical problems. These
actors are named by occupation, by group ('riders on a bike
tour'), or by fictional name ('Chantal'). The combination
of hidden agency alongside human actors may send mixed
messages to a reader about the role of human beings in
mathematics.
</p>

<p>
Though the paucity of personal pronouns and the absence
of first person pronouns 'I' and 'we' is typical of mathematics
textbooks, we are reminded that this need not be so. For
example, we know of two mathematics textbooks that
employ an 'I' voice. Zimmer et al. (2000) include examples
of students' thoughts, which use the 'I' voice, and Frankenstein's
(1989) book <i>Radical maths</i>, uses the 'I' voice in more
diverse ways, but this book is an atypical textbook in many
other ways, too.
</p>

<p>
The modality of a text also points to the text's construction
of the role of humans in relation to mathematics. The
modality of the text includes "indications of the degree of
likelihood, probability, weight or authority the speaker 
attaches to an utterance" (Hodge and Kress, 1993, p. 9).
Modality can be found in the "use of modal auxiliary verbs
(must, will, could, etc.), adverbs (certainly, possibly) or
adjectives (e.g., I am sure that...)" (Morgan, 1996, p. 6).
With such forms, the text suggests that mathematics is something
that people can be sure about (for example, with the
adverb 'certainly') or that people can imagine possibilities
within mathematics (e.g., with the adverb 'possibly').
</p>

<p>
Linguists use the term 'hedges' to describe words that
index uncertainty. For instance, because of the hedge
'might' in 'That function might be linear,' there is less certainty
than in the unhedged 'That function is linear.' Some
hedges in TMM are 'about', 'might' and 'may'. This kind
of hedging could raise questions about the certainty of what
is being expressed and could also, as Rowland (2000)
asserts, open up for readers an awareness of the value of
conjecture.
</p>

<p>
Modality also appears in verb choice. Strong modal verbs
coupled with a paucity of hedging suggest that mathematical
knowledge can be and ought to be expressed with
certainty. Such an absolutist image suggests that mathematics
is not contingent on human particularities. What role
would this give the student? In TMM, for example, a voice
of certainty is expressed because the verbs that express
stronger conviction (would, can, and will) are much more
common than those that communicate weaker conviction
(could and should). The UCSMP seems to privilege strong
modality even more by including relatively less modal
verbs, by using a higher proportion of strong modal verbs,
and by using the very strong modal verb 'must', which does
not appear in TMM.
</p>

<p>
Pictures alongside verbal text impact the reader's experience
of the text, just as text colours the reader's
interpretation of pictures. For instance, we can compare
'generic' drawings and 'particular' photographs. To illustrate,
a drawing of a boy could represent any boy [5],
whereas a photograph of a boy is a representation of only the
one boy in the photograph. A comparison between drawings
and photographs is more significant when seen in
relation to linguistic features that have similar effects. For
example, TMM's preference for the more generic drawings
is substantiated by its paucity of personal pronouns.
Together, these features may draw attention to mathematics'
penchant for generality. However, this image is
mitigated somewhat by some photographs and, as stated
above, by some references to humans in word problems.
</p>

<p>
This obfuscation can be heightened by an absence of people
in the graphic images. Attention to the roles played by
the people in the images also affects the student's sense of
how people relate to mathematics. In the TMM text, for
example, only one quarter of the images have people in
them. In these, we find people playing on teeter-totters and
operating cranes (among other things), but only one image
of a person doing mathematics. Significantly, this image is
a drawing (which makes the person generic) and it only
shows the person's hand conducting a mathematical investigation
(Figure 1). This disembodied, generic hand may
parallel the missing face of the mathematician in agencymasking
sentences, but it may also be taken as an invitation
to the reader to imagine his or her own hand operating in 
the diagram's environment. [6] Indeed, the loss of particularity
in agency-masked renderings is inherently related to
the development of generality. A reader can experience both
interpretations simultaneously even though they might
appear to be conflicting.

</i><p><p>
By contrast to the image of the person conducting the mathematical
investigation, TMM also has an image of mathematics
being done on a person - a man is being measured
(Figure 2). Here, the person is a generic adult male (and so not
the model reader) who is the subject of mathematics, but there
is no indication in the drawing, or the relevant verbal text, that
suggests a person is doing the mathematics. Perhaps the
reader can infer that he is doing the mathematics to himself.

<h2>How might a text position students in relation to other
people?</h2>
<p>
Most students learn mathematics within a social environment.
Recognizing, as shown by Johansson (2007), that the
teacher can position a textbook in various ways, we add that
the textbook also positions students and teachers in various 
ways. Given their experience of their classroom community,
we ask how the text positions students in relation to the people
around them - their teachers and their peers. [7] Various
aspects of the text, including the ways the authors directly
address the reader, position the model student in relation to
these people.
<p>
sentences structured in the imperative mood. Morgan (1996)
asserts such imperatives (or commands) tacitly mark the
reader as a capable member of the mathematics community.
However, we suggest that such positioning is not clear from
the mere presence of imperatives. Rotman (1988) distinguishes
between what he calls inclusive imperatives (describe,
explain, prove), which ask the reader to be a thinker, and
what he calls exclusive imperatives (write, calculate, copy),
which ask the reader to be a scribbler. Mathematicians
do both, they think and scribble. We find significance in
Rotman's terms: inclusive and exclusive. The 'thinker'
imperatives construct a reader whose actions are included
in a community of people doing mathematics, whereas the
'scribbler' imperatives construct one whose actions can be
excluded from such a community. The student who scribbles
can work independent from other people (including teacher
and peers).
<p>
We caution against premature characterization of a text
based only on the number or percentage of these different
kinds of imperatives. When we follow the flow of imperatives
in a text, we can form a better picture of the model
student constructed by it. For example, in TMM's initial
'investigation,' we find the following stream of imperatives
(pp. 5, 6): 'make a bridge', 'fold the paper', 'suspend the
bridge', 'place the cup', 'put pennies in', 'record the number',
'put strips together', 'find the weight', 'repeat', 'do the
experiment', 'make a table', 'graph your data', 'describe the
pattern', 'suppose you use'. Of these 14 imperatives, the first
12 are exclusive and the last two inclusive. Does this mean
that scribbling is privileged over thinking because of the
ratio 12:2? No. Though this ratio of 6:1 is not significantly
different from the UCSMP ratio of approximately 10:1, the
UCSMP positioning of 'thinker' imperatives as part of independently
worked 'exercises' and without directions for
scribbling first may mitigate their inclusive effect. It is
appropriate to scribble before thinking. Furthermore, if a
text makes too many 'thinker' demands, it could be tacitly
encouraging students to jump from one thought to another
without dwelling on any of the 'thinker' demands.
<p>
This raises a further question about the model students'
relations to the people around them. It is important to see
whether a textbook mentions that other people need to be
considered when students engage in the thinking imperatives.
Looking again at the closing imperatives in the above
TMM sequence, we note that a student could ask,
'Describe? Describe to whom?' The same goes for TMM's
most prevalent 'thinker' imperative: 'explain'. If the students
are expected to explain their reasoning, they might
reasonably expect some direction from the text with regard
to their audience.
<p>
Exceptions to this absence of reference to the people
around the model student must be investigated. [8] For
example, at the end of each section in TMM, the text 
includes a page called <i>Mathematical reflections</i>. In each of
these sections, the same sentence follows the prompts for
reflection:
<p>
<Blockquote>Think about your answers to these questions, discuss
your ideas with other students and your teacher, and
then write a summary of your findings in your journal.
(e.g., p. 25)</Blockquote>
<p>
From this, the model student might see himself or herself
doing mathematics independently, but reflecting on his or
her mathematics in community.
<p>
<h2>How might a text position students in relation to their experience of the world?</h2>
<p>
While we suggest that explicit linguistic reference to the student's
audience would be appropriate in a mathematics
textbook, we recognise that such reference may raise
further questions. As soon as a student is led to explain
something to other people, he or she is likely to require a
reason and context for the explanation. He or she would
want to tailor their explanation to the situation and the people's
needs within the situation.
<p>
Though mathematics textbooks may place the mathematics
in 'real life' contexts (with few exceptions), linguistic and
other clues can still point to an insignificant relationship
between the student and his or her world. Attending to the
particular instances of low modality (expressing low levels
of certainty) with those of high modality, we begin to see
what experiences the text foregrounds. First, we look at references
to the student's past experiences. Textbooks may
refer with uncertainty to the student's experiences outside the
classroom using hedging words like probably or might - for
example, when referring students to their experiences with
a teeter-totter TMM tells the student, "You might have found
the balance point by trial and error" (p. 28). However, the
text expresses certainty about the student's abstract mathematical
experiences, as in "In your earlier work, you saw that
linear relationships can be described by equations" (p. 9).
There are pragmatic reasons for such assertions. The authors
must work under the assumption that the student has learned
particular mathematical ideas before they can move on to the
next section. Yet, the authors cannot really know who their
readers are. TMM's authors hedge statements about students'
experiences to acknowledge this. We are left wondering
what message the model reader might take away from
this. Would the reader think that his or her everyday experiences
matter less than their mathematical experiences?
<p>
This kind of suggestion can be substantiated by word
problem settings. Though most problems are situated in
everyday contexts, the sequencing of problems in mathematics
textbooks can jump from one setting to another. For
example, in TMM's first set of "applications, connections
and extensions" (pp. 15f), the student is asked to exercise his
or her mathematics on bridge design, bus trip planning, economic
forecasting, fuel monitoring, and the list goes on.
Similar to our point about well-placed inclusive imperatives
to promote students' thoughtfulness, we suggest that longer
series of problems relating to a particular context would
guide students to see real life in its complexity, as opposed to 
operating on the basis of brief glimpses of small-scoped data
sets. Unlike TMM's problem sets and unlike the UCSMP
contexts, TMM's 'investigations' do dwell longer on given
problem contexts.
<p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>
We have already noted above the impossibility of nailing
down the effect of a textbook authors' linguistic choices
(e.g., the ratio of inclusive to exclusive imperatives has significance
but the positioning of these imperatives is also
important). In addition to this kind of limitation, there are
limitations inherent in using commercially published texts,
which by their nature ignore particularities of context and
human individuality by reaching for a general audience. This
sense of depersonalisation is heightened by the textbook's
intended use - as a guidebook to help children develop predetermined
outcomes.
<p>
Furthermore, the sense of detachment that might appear in
mathematics textbooks should come as no surprise because
mathematics is characterised by abstraction: Balacheff (1988)
has noted the necessity of decontextualisation, depersonalisation
and detemporalisation in logical reasoning. We draw
attention to his prefix de- (as opposed to the alternative prefix
a-). Balacheff does not call for apersonal, atemporal,
acontextual language: he is not saying mathematics is devoid
of context. Rather, mathematics requires the move from personal
to impersonal, and, we add, the move back. Persons are
central to such moves. These are moves between being situated
in a physical and temporal context and truth independent
of context. Just as mathematics is about the moves from the
particular to general and back again, we see mathematisation
as the moves between the personal and impersonal, between
context and abstraction. Mathematics lives in this tension.
<p>
While these kind of moves are at the heart of mathematics,
they are also part of any didactic situation, as Kang and
Kilpatrick (1992) remind us in their consideration of the way
mathematics textbooks function in school settings:
<p>
<blockquote>knowledge is depersonalized and decontextualized
when represented for communication, personalized and
contextualized when first encountered, depersonalized
and decontextualized again as it becomes part of the
learner's codified knowledge. (p. 6)</blockquote>
<p>
Such 'didactic transposition' is perhaps most vivid in mathematics
learning because of the abstraction and generality that
are evident in the content, and, as we have shown, in the form
of the linguistic representation, which reflects that content.
<p>
Though our textbooks do not typically recognise the
moves we associate with mathematisation, we see room in
textbook use for the recognition of mathematisation. In typical
classrooms, the textbook is mediated through a person
(the teacher) in a conversation amongst many persons (the
students). In such a community, even if the textual material
at hand insufficiently recognises the role of persons in mathematics,
there is room to attend to persons and contexts.
There is room to draw awareness to the dance of agency
between particular persons (whether they are historical or
modern, professional or novice mathematicians) and the
apparently abstract, static discipline of mathematics. [9] For
textbook writers, too, there is room for change. Considering 
this possibility, we wonder how students' experiences
of mathematics would differ if their textbooks did more to
recognise persons, their contexts and mathematisation.

[1] Sierpinska (1997) differentiates between a text's <i>mathematical layer</i> and
its <i>didactic layer</i>. However, she does not draw attention to the way each
informs the other.
<br>[2] Morgan's (1996) linguistic analysis of students' mathematical writing
draws on CDA scholarship and successfully denaturalizes aspects of the
discursive practice. Her attention to the students' sense of audience and to
the markers' determinations of student work uncovers significant power
relations in classroom mathematics and assessment.
<br>[3] Umberto Eco refers to this phenomenon as the development of the
model reader. Sierpinska (1997) describes this phenomenon well.
<br>[4] In line with Foucauldian analysis of discourse, which is seen as an
archaeology, we refer to the analysed textbooks as artefacts: they are artefacts
of current sociological systems and practice. Furthermore, our use of
the word 'artefact' reminds us that future generations may use our current
textbooks as artefacts to gain insight into our present culture, just as
Schubring (1987) used mathematics textbooks from the French revolution
to gain insight into that time.
<br>[5] Drawings are <i>relatively</i> generic in comparison to photographs. The
drawing of a boy may suggest particular socio-economic, cultural or ethnic
identities, and thus represent a 'class of boys.'
<br>[6] We thank Wee Tiong Seah for noting the possibility of this interpretation.
<br>[7] In addition to teachers and other students, there are other people connected
to the mathematics that is practised in classrooms - including
mathematicians and people who use mathematics publicly, such as the press
and politicians. McBride (1994) shows textbook excerpts that suggest
mathematics is done independent of such cultural context. We argue that her
analysis could be strengthened with linguistic tools such as the ones we
use here. She does not show how individualism is promoted by the text.
Though our framework does not preclude consideration of how texts position
students in relation to public mathematics, we focus here on students'
relations to the people closest to them in the classroom setting.
<br>[8] Because we were interested in the reader's positioning, our findings all
come from our examination of student editions. However, there are places
in TMM's teacher edition that encourage teachers to have their students
work together such as 'partner quizzes' and suggested group work.
<br>[9] Pickering (1995), in his model for understanding scientific advancement,
distinguishes between "individual", "material" and "disciplinary"
agency. He calls generative tension between these agents a "dance of
agency." His sense of the dance of agency has been applied to relatively
local settings (mathematics classrooms) by Boaler (2002).
